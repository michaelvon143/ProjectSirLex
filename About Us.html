        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Philippine College of Northwestern Luzon! Where <br>we are dedicated to your growth, learning, and success.Our mission is to <br>create a dynamic learning environment where students thrive academically and socially.</p>
        <h2>PCNL HISTORY</h2>
        <p><h4>
            The demand of a globalized era is so high that it requires a competitive labor force or the development of
            highly skilled and well-educated human resources. To attain these, all learning institutions must exert
            effort to harness the potentials of their students to have globally competitive graduates. Until a higher
            educational institution (HEI) was established after a survey was conducted by way of random sampling of
            parents from La Union and from the northern and western towns of Pangasinan whose children are in elementary
            and secondary schools could be prospective students of the proposed HEI.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            After the organizational meeting of the incorporators, the organization came up with the name Philippine
            College of Northwestern Luzon (PCNL) with articles of incorporation and by-laws duly approved by the
            Securities and Exchange Commission, Baguio Extension Office on the 20th day of February 2007.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            All CHED requirements were prepared by the group including the province’s prospective courses to be offered
            which are the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), Bachelor of Science in Accountancy
            (BSA), Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSE), Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEE), and Bachelor of
            Science in Information Technology (BSIT). While waiting for the approval from the Commission on Higher
            Education (CHED), the Board of Trustees also discussed offering short-term courses by TESDA. After their
            technical visit, PCNL was permitted to offer Computer Hardware Servicing NC II, Computer Programming NC IV,
            PC Operation NC II, and Tourism Housekeeping NC II in SY 2007–2008.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            In February 2008, CHED approved BSBA and BSA to start in SY 2008–2009. Later, BSE and BEE followed, then
            BSIT and Criminology. Teacher Education Programs aim to prepare educators; BSBA majors in Financial
            Management and HRDM aim to boost the economy; BSIT contributes to tech innovation; Criminology helps maintain
            peace; and TESDA courses enhance student skills and create college pathways.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            PCNL is situated in a learning-friendly environment. Its “Old Building” was within Agoo Montessori Learning
            Center, while the “New Building” is beside Agoo Public Cemetery, surrounded by rice fields. Facilities
            include classrooms, Housekeeping and Dark Rooms, 2 Computer Labs, a Speech Lab, Science Lab, AV Room, library,
            faculty room, and an open court with a stage. The New Building houses more classrooms and the Administration
            Office. Based on the 5-year plan (2007–2012), facility improvements continue. Initial investment was
            ₱3.9M.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            PCNL aims to be socially desirable and economically viable by increasing professionals in the region, enabling
            local and overseas employment, and contributing to industry growth, job generation, and better quality of
            life.
          </h4>
        <h2>MISSION</h2>
        <p>In support of its philosophy, PCNL mandates itself to provide advanced quality instruction to its clientele in education, <br>the arts of humanities, the sciences, technology, business, and other professional and technical fields; promote <br>the advancement of knowledge through research; and help to improve the quality of community life through extension work.</p>
